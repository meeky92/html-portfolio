                <p><em>Not much to say</em>&#128517</p>
                <p>Hello! I'm Eunice. I'm from a Chicago suburb but currently living in the city. I moved back last fall after living in LA for 3 years.
                    I love to cook (to eat) and am very excited for fall things but still in denial about summer ending. I'm currently watching Mad Men
                    for the first time and I'm a bit bummed that I will probably not be able to watch as much as I'd like to for the next 10 weeks. I'm
                    mostly nervous about the course but excited to try something different. Looking forward to getting to know everyone in my cohort!
                </p>

                <h1>A Leap</h1>
                <em>Why Coding?</em>
                <p>I've been an ICU nurse for a little over 7 years and have wanted to leave bedside nursing for some time. Several long years of feeling burned out that
                    were exacerbated by the pandemic pushed things over the edge for me. I imagine many of us have gone through a similar feeling. I initially 
                    looked into other non bedside nursing roles and was extremely discouraged during that process as I couldn't get jobs that I was excited about. I wasn't
                    sure that I was ready for a career change as I've only been in healthcare and wasn't confident I had transferrable skills.</p>
                <p>    
                    I'm fortunate to have friends in other interesting fields and was intrigued by software engineering. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure I'm suited for this world, but 
                    I am drawn to the field's stability and its never ending use of problem solving. I didn't think that a coding bootcamp would be something I could or should 
                    attempt but I figured trying something terrifying and failing was still a better idea than returning to an ICU.
                    I'm lucky to have support from family and I'm excited to see how I'll grow these next couple of months.
